## MUSA 500 Spatial Statistics and Data Analytics
The goal of this course is to familiarize students with a number of statistical and data mining techniques commonly used for analyzing different types of urban data. The course will have two key parts: 1) regression analysis for urban data, and 2) identifying patterns in urban data.

Even though the course will cover the theory and mathematics behind the majority of the statistical methods, it will focus mostly on their applications.

Students will learn when each statistical test should be used and the assumptions behind each test. In addition, while the R software will be used for most of the course, students will also learn to use several other software packages, such as GeoDa and VIS-STAMP. Finally, students will learn how to describe and interpret the output of the analyses that they run.

## [MUSA 508 Public Policy Analytics](https://urbanspatial.github.io/PublicPolicyAnalytics/)

Data scientists convert data into actionable intelligence. While most private sector data scientists optimize for profit, their public sector counterparts must address multiple complex bottom lines including economics, equity, politics, bureaucracy and social cohesion. This course teaches students how to wrangle government data; how to mine it for descriptive and predictive intelligence and how to communicate results to non-technical decision-makers. Broadly, coursework is focused on spatial analysis and geospatial machine learning and taught 70/30 in R and ArcGIS. Use cases include home price prediction, forecasting in criminal justice, land use modeling, transportation modeling and real estate site suitability. Prerequisites include vector and raster GIS and introductory statistics.

## CPLN 632 Modeling Geographic Space

The major objective of this course is to explore the nature and use of raster-oriented geographic information systems (GIS) for the analysis and synthesis of spatial patterns and processes. Modeling Geographical Space course is oriented more toward the qualities of geographical space itself (e.g. proximity, density, or interspersion) than the discrete objects that may occupy such space (e.g. water bodies, land parcels, or structures).
